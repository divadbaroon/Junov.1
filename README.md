### Step 1: Install Required Packages

Run the following command to install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Customize Configuration

Open the secret configuration file in your text editor for customization:

```bash
code configuration/secrets/secret_config.yaml
```
Update the file with your personal settings and save it.

### Step 3: Sign into Azure Account

Log into your Azure account using the Azure CLI:

```bash
az login
```

### Step 4: Create Azure Resources

Navigate to the infra directory and run the script to create the necessary Azure resources:

```bash
cd infra && ./create_infrastructure.sh
```
**What This Does**: 
- A Resource Group is built containing Speech Services, Language Understanding, and Translator resources.
- A Key Vault is also created to securely store all essential keys and endpoint values.

### Step 5: Encrypt and Secure Secret Data

Navigate back to root directory and run the script to save and encrypt all secret data locally:

```bash
cd .. && python -m configuration.manage_secrets
```

### Step 6: Train CLU Model

Start the training session for your Conversation Language Understanding (CLU) model using the provided training data
located within 'training/virtual_assitant_training_data':

```bash
python -m training.begin_training_session
```
After training and deploying is complete, you can view your trained model at: https://language.cognitive.azure.com/home

### Step 7: Fine-tune GPT (Optional)

Begin a fine-tuning session for GPT using the provided training data located within 'training/gpt_training_data':

```bash
python -m training.begin_gpt_training_session
```

## Usage
1. Run the program: `python main.py`
2. Wait for the startup sound to play, indicating that the assistant is now listening for input
3. Interact with the assistant by speaking

## Supported Packages
Packages come with prebuilt commands.
Intent recognition is done using your trained CLU model, allowing for versatile command phrasing.
