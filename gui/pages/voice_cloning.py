    Welcome to Juno's Custom Voice Creator!

    With this interface, you can:

    1. **Create Your Own Custom Voice**: Convert a high-quality audio sample into a voice that can be used by ElevenLabs' voice generation service.
    
    2. **Test Your Voice**: After successfully creating a custom voice, ensure it meets your expectations by testing it live.
    
    Start by uploading a clear, high-quality audio sample. This sample is essential to create a voice that is representative of the source. Ideally, the sample should be at least 5 minutes long for optimal results. After the cloning process, you can update or create a profile within Juno that uses the new ElevenLabs voice name.
    
    Dive in and craft your unique voice!
